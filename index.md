## About Me

Hello! I am Rio, a rising undergraduate senior who’s excited to be a part of Gallaudet’s REU AICT 10-week summer research program in accessible computing! Outside of research this summer, I deliver pizza for Domino’s and play in an ultimate frisbee league. I have two rabbits at home in Acton, MA where I currently reside; one of them pictured above.
