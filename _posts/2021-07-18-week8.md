title: Week 8!
---
Did 6 studies this past week. 6 more scheduled this upcoming week. Lots to do in not lots of time. Preprocessing the data for analysis is very labor intensive. Sad won’t have enough time as I’d like to do deeper analysis. Apologies for the short update this week. Will write up a more extensive reflection week 10. :)
